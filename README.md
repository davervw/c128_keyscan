# C64/C128 to USB keyboard HID driver #

## Simple 32u4 Pro Micro version - C128 extra keys not supported. ##

This hardware and software allows a Commodore 64 or Commodore 128 keyboard to be used as a USB HID keyboard (minus keys not present on C64).

    Status: there are some multiple key presses (same row) issues.  So this version is not recommended for production use.

    WARNING!!! wiring has changed since photo was taken.

DB-25 to Pro Micro wiring instructions are in source code.
